Please identify the design patterns that are used in [Code](https://github.com/WonderTools/design-patterns/releases/tag/Challenge-03)

## Part2
[This](https://github.com/WonderTools/design-patterns/releases/tag/Challenge-03) is the source code of vehicle simulator. Currently this has been used to simulate a car in a video game. As a new feature, the product owner has decided to bike in addition to car. The current remote is very much coupled to the car. Please refactor this so that the remote could be used with the bike.
