## Challenge 02

### Problem Statement
As a car manufacturer, our company coordinates with tier 1 suppliers to get various components of the car developed.
Till now we have been using Alarm produced by MdfManufacturers. The interface for the component has been shared with them, and they manufacture against the interface.

The engineers found an Alarm Maufactured by Freecol to have a more pleasing sound effect. Freecol's Alarms that are readily available over the counter along with the driver software. The management has decided to use Freecol Alarms for Hi-End cars and the traditional Alarms for normal cars.

Please modify the [code](https://wondertools.github.io/GitHubDownloader/#/home?url=https://github.com/WonderTools/design-patterns/tree/master/Problem02) to integrate Freecol Alarms for Hi End cars


The code base should be able to run on both Hi End and Normal Cars.

In the file appsettings.json, the field "carType" will have "normal" or "hiEnd" depending on the type of car.
